```
INFRASTRUCTURE AS ART/DESIGN

- INFRASTRUCTURE THRIVES ON POTENTIALS
- INFRASTRUCTURE IS EVER ONLY REALIZED THROUGH IT S USE
- INFRASTRUCTURE MUST LURE INTO DESIRING POSSIBLE FUTURES
- INFRASTRUCTURE IS EMPATHIC
- INFRASTRUCTURE THRIVES ON ALTRUISM BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO SUCH NOTIONS
- INFRASTRUCTURE MAY BE CRITICAL OR DISRUPTIVE
- INFRASTRUCTURE MAY CONNECT TO EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURES
- INFRASTRUCTURE MAY HACK EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURES
- INFRASTRUCTURE MAY NOT REVEAL ITSELF AS AN ART/DESIGN WORK IMMEDIATELY OR EVER
- INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT CONFINED TO WIKIPEDIAâ€™S DESCRIPTION OF *INFRASTRUCTURE*
- INFRASTRUCTURE LURKS BELOW AND HOVERS ABOVE AT THE SAME TIME
- INFRASTRUCTURE IS THE *NATIVE MATERIAL UNDERNEATH A CONSTRUCTED PAVEMENT*
